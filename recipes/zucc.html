        <h2>Wonderfully crispy zucchini chips that are both tasty and healthy!</h2>

        <div>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil spray</li>
            <li>2 medium zucchini (about 1 lb. total weight)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Parmesan grated</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
       
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with high-heat-resistant parchment paper and coat it with olive oil spray.</li>
            <li>Slice the zucchini into ⅛-inch-thick rounds. Sprinkle the slices with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. Place the salted zucchini in a colander in the sink and let them stand for 30 minutes at room temperature. This should draw some of the water out. After 30 minutes, rinse and blot dry the zucchini slices using paper towels.</li>
            <li>Arrange the zucchini slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Spray them with olive oil. Bake them for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Sprinkle the zucchini slices with the remaining ¼ teaspoon of kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and grated Parmesan. There's no need to flip the zucchini.</li>
            <li>Return the pan to the oven and continue baking until the zucchini slices are browned and crisp, 15-20 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
